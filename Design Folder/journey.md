# Our Journey through the Design Sprint

## Pre design week

* The intial idea as part of pitching the project to be selected:
    * An app for the FAC community, where FAC alums and students can search for and connect with each other based on their technical stack skills.
    * As a user, I can create an account and display my skills and technical stack. I can search for and connect with other FACers based on their skills - for example, if I’m interested in learning more about a specific technology or looking for a potential partner to work with on a project.

* [Inspiration Board](https://hackmd.io/slQRHTO0TLCcGcsFrLM1Qg) set up and used for design inspiration
* Decided on team roles:
    * @laweks - QA
    * @vlbee - DevOpts
    * @helenzhou6 - Scrum Master
    * @tdoran - UX
* [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/fac-13/stackMatch) set up to for any discussions

## Week One - Design Sprint

### Day One

_Stage: **Emphasise** > Define > Ideate > Prototype > Test_

* Used the **Research Learning Spiral** to complete the emphasise stage.
    1) **Objectives** - completed the “5W + H” (Who, What, When, Where, Why and How) questions [here](https://hackmd.io/cHyCdpxaT9iZFRblPMSlFQ)
    2) From the above generated **hypotheses** - what we are trying to solve based on what we know
       * A FAC network/community exists and engages / beyond the 16 week course and being physically present in Space4 – it is supportive of other FAC members beyond their time here
       * Show that a tech solution can sustain the community beyond the 16 weeks - and encourage creativity for projects and spontaneous/radical collaboration across the FAC community
        * Facilitate easily being able to connect with the FAC community - sense of community
    4) **Methods** - decided already as a survey, user personas and secondary research.
    5) **Conduct** - obtained data from actual users using secondary research, [User Personas](https://hackmd.io/23BSoPvySbaUfR3iXG3tQg) and a [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGnw8qWJ_Qu59_T6ZTiB_UONUsP2SL4aQhK1iq0vccV2-2qA/viewform)
       * Secondary research involved interviewing hiring manager and previewing an exisiting app made previously with similar objectives
       * Survey sent to all FAC, consisted of open but short answer questions related to the behaviour of job hunting
       * User personas: FAC graduate freelancer, recent FAC graduate, hiring manager and FAC graduate junior developer.
       ![User personas](https://i.imgur.com/4IVs5Hj.png)
    6) **Synthesis** - reflected on the research obtained and saw if the hypotheses still applied.
        * Found that there were two very different potential purposes of the product - either connecting FAC members together or an product that made the FAC hiring manager's job easier (less admin involved). After a group discussion we decided to focus on the latter (revising the hypotheses).

### Day Two

_Stage: Emphasise > **Define** > Ideate > Prototype > Test_

* Based on the findings from the emphasise stage, wrote **problem statements**
    * As a FAC member, I need to hear about new opportunities that interest me, so that I can find a job I love without it feeling tedious and stressful
    * The Hiring manager needs a way to do less admin so that he can spend more time connecting frads with meaningful job opportunities.

* Divergent exercise to attempt to turn these problems into opportunities using "How Might We (HMW)". Grouped these into themes:
* ![Themes of HMWs](https://i.imgur.com/Sp0tilH.jpg)

* After reviewing, the decided on two important HMWs to focus on for the first iteration of the app:

### Day Three

_Stage: Emphasise > **Define** > Ideate > Prototype > Test_

* Narrowing down to find features of the Minimal Viable Product (MVP), from research into services that people use already related to the hypothesis:
    * **Inspirational Overview** - (the services used now) and **Product/process audit** - (the process)
    ![Inspirational Overview and product/process audit](https://i.imgur.com/t2yB1JO.jpg)
    
* After team discussion, decided on the big picture goal for the product:
    ![big picture goal](https://i.imgur.com/j3AuSnR.jpg) 
    
_Stage: Emphasise > Define > **Ideate** > Prototype > Test_

* Deciding on the user interaction:
    * The idea of the product as a message service - diagolue between the site and the user:
    ![product as a message service](https://i.imgur.com/9jaLb0g.jpg)
    
* Each team member did Crazy 8s - using drawings to try and achieve the goal in an inventive way (**divergent** mode of thinking)
* Each team member drew storyboards - ordered set of screen designs to demonstrate user journey (this is the visual version of the message service)

    ![storyboards](https://i.imgur.com/fRO4wei.jpg)

* Each member presented their ideas to the others within a minute.
* Silent contemplation by the team to review all the ideas put forward, and silent voting on features and storyboards.
    
* Team review of the combined storyboards / crazy 8s (taking into account the votes) and decided on which user journey and best features to act on in the first iteration of the product(**convergent** mode of thinking)

### Day Three & Four

_Stage: Emphasise > Define > Ideate > **Prototype** > Test_

* Used findings from ideate stage to design the initial user journey (page by page) - HMW make it easy for the FAC graduate to add information to their profile - using Sketch.

* Then focused on the second HMW: "As a FAC Member/HM, I want to go to a specific profile according to specific criteria so that I can contact them."
    * The product as a messaging service for the second user journey:
    ![message service](https://i.imgur.com/1DDy1tw.jpg)
    * Did the Crazy 8s, storyboards, silent voting and then group discussion
        ![divergent process to decide on user journey](https://i.imgur.com/2rwFqH5.jpg)
    * Team decided on the user journey storyboard and key features to focus on to address the second HMW.
    * Sketch designs were updated to include second user journey.
        * Example of the profile page:
        ![Profile page - old design](https://i.imgur.com/LaiCLTj.png)

* As a team decided on what information should be displayed [in the user profile and menu](https://hackmd.io/62vjBi0UTKqlgPnB5i1rvQ#Prototype)

* Used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/UJNc3j6eNaQN0OLIA5qCZpPD/Prototype) - to collaborate on the design and used [Invision](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/CAHZDNHYFZQ#/screens/295067447) to generate clickable user interface, ready for testing.

### Day Five
_Stage: Emphasise > Define > Ideate > Prototype > **Test**_

* Decided on [script for user testing](https://hackmd.io/Al_NEK6XTsm9DpyJ8_pjmw?edit), and set up a phone ready for testing using [Invision](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/CAHZDNHYFZQ#/screens/295067447). 

* Tested 5 FAC users (4 FAC members, one member of the general public) and documented the interview. 
* Reviewed the results from the survey.

* Each issue was written on a post it note and grouped:
    ![post it note - user feedback](https://i.imgur.com/q8Osnti.jpg)

* After looking at the common themes, the major problems after feedback from users were identified:
    * UX: Not intuitive that you can edit parts of the profile (users throught it was a landing page or dashboard)
        * Discussed with the group: either have a mock profile page with parts that are clearly 'edittable' using icons, or a form with labelled inputs etc and on submit it will transform it into a condensed 'profile' page. The latter was chosen since easier to implement quickly.
    * Filtering: No apply button on filter. Filter button difficult to find and unexpected layout of the filters.

* Redesigned the site with the user feedback in mind (including updating the style guide).
    * Changed the theme to dark, so that a 'card' system could be used for each profile.
    * As discussed before, changed the design to have 'edit' mode and 'preview' mode of your own profile to make it more intuitive. Upon sign up, you could view the basic profile with clear edit buttons on each section, and then on click of the edit button a modal would appear with the form related to that section.
        * Example of the profile page:
        ![Profile page - new design](https://i.imgur.com/YzuVvtO.png)
    * Changed the filter button and added search icon to the top of the page, added clear functions, and changed the filter so that it would slide to the left of the page. Changed the cohort filter to 'nodes' so that multiple could be selected.
